This README is not complete yet.

## Todo

Here is my todo list.

### Bugs to be fixed

- "returned null" error, trouble fetching+decryping entries from database on second session/other device (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Modals on mobile are sometimes too far down
- Typing to name a tag is only possible on mobile
- "Shared entries" page shows your own entries (should only show entries from others that have been shared with you)
- When choosing people to add to a tag, it shows yourself as an option (it should only show people beside yourself)
- Searching for users should be overhauled to be more private
- Optimize more components for /lib/styles

### Features to add

- Integrate tags with frontmatter (feasible?)
- Clicking on a shared entry should be viewable (read only)
- (ROADMAP) Eventually add collaboration features
- Shareable link
